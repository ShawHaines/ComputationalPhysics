# Subtractive Cancelation

One instance where subtractive cancelation can occur involves finding the roots of a quadratic equation with the quadratic formula as 

$$
x_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4a c}}{2a}
$$

For cases where $b^2\gg 4ac$, the difference in the numerator can be very small.

In such cases, double precision may be employed; Alternatively, an equivalent formulation can be used to iniize subtractive cancelation, i.e.

$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-2c}{b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}
$$

To give an illustration, compute the values of the roots of a quadratic equation with $a=1, b=3000.001$ and $c=3$. Furthermore, check the computed values versus the true roots of $x_1 = -0.001$ and $x_2 = -3000$.
